**Why I chose software development**

I chose software development because I figured it'd be a good starting point to my goal of becoming a computer programmer ,which will be a good starting point to my end goal of becoming a game programmer. What keeps me interested in programming is the idea of creating something people can be intrigued with, ever since I solved my first algorithm in javascript, i've been on a nonstop train to learning new code.  I worked at McDonalds for a year and left to go study at Coding Dojo, I became a fullstack developer, and graduated with high honors. Unfortunately, I'm not very good at searching for jobs that hire people with little experience and as a result, I need something big to add to my resume. I have high hopes for this program and I will do whatever I can to get a job in the software development industry.

**What I hope to gain from this program**

I hope this program will be more involved in me starting my career because despite having the knowledge to create things, I don't know how to market myself let alone network efficiently. I hope I meet life long companions through this program that I can someday rely on, I tend to trip over obstacles ,and even though I have a strong support system, it doesn't hurt to add on to it. I hope I gain even more knowledge on programmimg and coding, you can never know too much. Finally, I hope I graduate with high honors.
